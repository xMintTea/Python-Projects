# File sorter 1.1v

## How it works?
1. A "sort" folder is created on your desktop
2. The script exits if the folder is empty. You must fill the folder with files and run the script again
3. Folders with the name of the file extension are created and the necessary files are moved to the folder that corresponds to their extension

## Change log 

- Bug fix:
    * a bug with the creation of folders with the name of the extension has been fixed. If the file had more than one dot in the name, then the folder had a strange name

- modified code

## Planned:

- [ ] **Sort files without extension**
- [ ] **Sorting folders**
- [ ] **Sort files from folders (optional)**
- [ ] **Choosing a sorting path**
