# How to use that program?

### 1. **A "sort"folder is created on your desktop**

### 2. **After that, you should add the files that you want to sort into folders there**

### 3. **Run the program again and that's it! All files are sorted into folders. Each file is located in a folder with the name of its extension. For example, the cat.png file will be located in the PNG folder**

# Bugs:
### 1. **if there is a dot in the file name, such as "DynamicSurroundings-1.12.2-3.6.1.0.jar", then create a folder "2-3.6.1.0.JAR". So consider this if you want to use this**
