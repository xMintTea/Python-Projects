# Date Sorter 1v


## How it works?
1. You are asked to select a folder to sort the files in it by the date of their creation or last interaction

2. After selecting a folder, the script scans all the files in the folder and creates new folders with the name of the creation date

3. After creating a folder, the file is moved to the desired folder. Sorting is done by year and month of creation

## Change log 


### **1v:**

## Planned:
- [ ] **Add the ability to sort folders by creation date (at the moment this is not available due to a bug)** *Planned in
version 1.1v*
